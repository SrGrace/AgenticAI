Turkey is home to over 85 million people; [8] most are ethnic Turks, while ethnic Kurds are the largest ethnic minority. [5] Officially a secular state, Turkey has a Muslim-majority population. Ankara is Turkey's capital and second-largest city. Istanbul is its largest city and economic center. Other major cities include İzmir, Bursa, and Antalya. Turkey (Türkiye) is a country that occupies a unique geographic position, lying partly in Asia and partly in Europe and serving as both a bridge and a barrier between them. The modern Turkish republic was founded in 1923 after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and its capital is Istanbul (formerly Constantinople). Ankara, formerly known as Ancyra and Angora, is the capital of Turkey, located in Central Anatolia. With a population of 4,587,558 in the urban centre (2014) and 5,150,072 in its province (2015), it is Turkey's second largest city behind Istanbul. Curious about what the capital of Turkey is? If you guessed Ankara, you're right! While Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, often steals the spotlight, Ankara has been the official capital of Turkey since 1923.
